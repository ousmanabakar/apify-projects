#### Welcome to Realtor Agents Scraper Pro üéâ

### ‚ú® About This Actor ‚ú®
The Realtor Agents Scraper Pro is a powerful tool that enables you to extract valuable data from Realtor's website, even though it lacks an API. This tool is specifically designed to help you overcome data retrieval challenges and gain insights for your real estate business.


One of the key features of the Realtor Agents Scraper Pro is its ability to scrape detailed information on agent profiles. With this tool, you can extract important details such as contact information, recent listings and more. This information can be used for a variety of purposes, including lead generation, market research, and competitive analysis.


## ‚ú® How to use it ‚ú®üìç

To use this scraper tool, follow these steps:

#### üìå Step-1

First, navigate to "https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/" in your web browser.

### üìåStep-3

  1. Once you have entered your search criteria, the website will display a list of agents that match your search.

  2. Copy the URL of the search results page from your browser's address bar.



### üìå Step-4

In the input area of the scraper tool, paste the URL you just copied into the "Start URLs" field



### üìå step-5

Once you have pasted the search results page URL into the scraper tool and configured any desired settings, you can run the scraper to start extracting data from the page. Depending on the size of the page and the complexity of the data you are extracting, the scraper may take a few minutes to complete.

Once the scraper has finished, you will be able to download the extracted data in a variety of formats, including CSV, Excel, JSON, HTML, and more. Simply select the format you prefer and download the file to your computer. With the scraped data in hand, you can use it to gain insights and make informed decisions for your real estate business.
